                    During the first semester community activism project, 
                    I was in charge of all the multimedia that was produced, 
                    as well as a small social media team. There were people in my
                     team that had previously made social media awareness posts, 
                     so I largely allowed them to work independent of myself, and 
                     asked them what they needed from me. I produced the elements
                      they needed, as well as a video and a number of custom graphics 
                      for the event. I learned a number of project management skills from 
                      my position on this committee, the most important of which was the 
                      renewed importance of time management skills.

                    During the second community activism project, I had no role, 
                    but still found myself involved, although in a significantly 
                    smaller way. I wasn’t given a role, but ended up designing my 
                    own social media post for the event because I didn’t like the ones 
                    that had been made for the event. I then posted it on my instagram 
                    story once per day until the event had ended. I didn’t really learn 
                    any new leadership skills from this event.
