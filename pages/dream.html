                    I recently applied for a leadership position on the Creative Suite team here at Creighton University. 
                    The Creative Suite is an on campus resource which the Division of Student Life can utilize to produce 
                    any multimedia needs. During my senior year, I could see myself continuing to work there in a 
                    supervising role, but I’m not sure as to what I’d be doing. I definitely would do my best to 
                    help students in the entry positions figure out what they wanted to achieve during their 
                    Creighton experience, and what they wanted to do after college. 
            <br>
            <br>
                    Outside of college, I’ll hopefully have started to create freelance multimedia, 
                    which is my ultimate goal in life. I’ve wanted to own my own company for years, 
                    nd I’m planning on starting it during college. Hopefully I’ve got some experience 
                    under my belt by the time my senior year rolls around, so that I can help other 
                    students who are hoping to be entrepreneurs.
