                    During the last year, I’ve had a number of incredible experiences, 
                    but the ones that stand out the most are those with my friends. Through FLP, 
                    I’ve found genuine people I truly enjoy being around and that I trust. 
                    Throughout high school, I had a bunch of friends that betrayed my trust and 
                    alienated me during my junior year, and consequently trusting others was very 
                    hard for me, but I made relationships with others who were willing to invest in me, 
                    and I was able to invest myself in them. It’s created a very comforting college 
                    experience, and has helped my year become what it is. 

                    When Mr. Thesien came to speak, he fundamentally changed my FLP experience, 
                    and inspired me for the first time all year. I wrote the following letter expressing my gratitude: 
                    
                <p id="letter">
                        Mr. Thesien,
                    <br>
                    <br>

                        During the week leading up to your talk, we were warned it would likely
                         go over, and consequently, a lot of people were talking about using their 
                         ‘skip’ that week. Myself included. As I walked down the mall, I was 
                         contemplating whether or not to skip it at the last second, but I didn’t, 
                         and in the end, I didn't. I wholeheartedly believe that your conversation 
                         was the best we’ve had the entire year, and most of my peers who went agreed. 
                         That being said, some students did skip, but those who didn’t were incredibly 
                         grateful they went, have constantly ‘rubbed’ your talk into them, and we still
                          talk about you and what you said in our classes, almost a month later. 
                          Almost my entire English class referenced you and your experiences during 
                          our last assignment — around a month after you spoke to us. 
                          You are constantly a topic of conversation among us as students, 
                          and we all seem to have learned several things from you.
                    <br>
                    <br> 
                        I made my bed the Wednesday after you talked to us. And the day after. 
                        And the day after. I’ve made my bed every single day since you spoke. 
                        I’ve finally taken my first steps to make my dreams for after University 
                        to become a reality. I got a job here on campus, and that job has offered 
                        me a potential internship position here over the summer. That was 12 days ago. 
                        Your openness inspired me to take the steps I’d been talking about taking for 
                        over a year now, and so I guess what I’m really trying to say is Thank you. 
                        You were a joy to listen to. You made an hour feel like five minutes, 
                        and that’s a rare feat nowadays.
                    <br>
                    <br> 
                        My name is Cole Mowery, and I’m dreaming of making a company 
                        which creates corporate media. If we could, I’d love to 
                        stay in touch. At the bottom of my email are all the places 
                        you can find me.
                    <br>
                    <br>   
                        Once again, I just wanted to say thank you for inspiring me to 
                        take the step I’d been talking about for two years now. 
                        I’m sure you’ve impacted my entire class, but I KNOW you’ve impacted me.
                </p>    

                    
                    My favorite FLP experience I had this year was to create the video 
                    for Precious Memories. I had the opportunity to make a new video for our 
                    Thanksgiving Dinner event, and while the other video was good, it didn’t 
                    have the professionalism that I wanted to add. I was ultimately able to 
                    create a video that was good, and created a new experience for the people 
                    it was intended for, I believe that I could have made it better in retrospect. 
                    I feel that it was too long for what it was trying to say, or at the very least 
                    repetitive. This embodies the things I find to be very important, and especially 
                    the idea that I learn from failure. While I didn’t fail in this situation, 
                    I definitely believe that I could have done a better job, and will carry 
                    these concerns into any future video project I create.
