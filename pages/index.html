                At the beginning of the year, my FLP mission statement was to, 
                “Use my creativity and compassion to inspire others to become the best versions of themselves, 
                and leave lasting impacts on the individuals they interact with.” This statement embodied my desire to create unique 
                experiences that resonate with individuals, and inspire them to do the same for the people in their own lives. 
            <br>
            <br>
                My new mission statement, “Make the ordinary Extraordinary” establishes the same goals as my original statement, 
                but does so in a better way, establishing my desire to leave lasting impacts on lives, as well as with every client 
                I interact with during my professional career. 
            <br>
            <br>   
                Throughout my experiences in FLP, I’ve become more interested in the work my dad does, 
                and the #1 thing that he has stated differentiates him from his competitors is the interactions he has with his clients. 
                As an individual who wants to enter creative field, learning how to differentiate my business as much as possible is essential. 
                Having the skills to make ordinary things ‘extraordinary’ whether it be a sales pitch or final product is a truly special skill that 
                will help me rise above the other in my field. 

            <br> 
            <br>       
                My leadership style hasn’t really changed this year. I’ve always been a person who learns from failure, and wants others to share
                their ideas, in hopes they are better than my own. I’d much rather expand upon others’ ideas than create from scratch, which is 
                interesting because I’m entering a creative field. My values have not changed at all, but rather I’ve been strengthened in my beliefs. 
                I love helping others make their ideas come to life, and have helped with a number of projects over the years.
