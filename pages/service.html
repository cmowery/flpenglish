                    I was fortunate in my ability to volunteer at Precious Memories both semesters, 
                    but Iâ€™ve had very different experiences during each semester. My first semester 
                    was led by Tony Franks and Emily Dempsey. I had an amazing time, and really fell in 
                    love with FLP as a result. I helped to create the video for the Fall 2018 community activism event.

                    My second semester of service built upon everything my first semester had, 
                    but also emphasized reflection. While I still went to Precious Memories during 
                    my second semester, I went with a different service group, led by Zach Banaszak 
                    and Ivie Sprenger. Reflection is very important to Zach, and made for a more wholistic 
                    service experience. I found myself thinking about what I was doing more. At first it felt 
                    really weird, but as the semester continued, I became far more comfortable with it.
