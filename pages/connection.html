                    I’ve designed my entire post-college career to build up as I traverse throughout college. 
                    My plan begins with making connections on campus and getting my skills well known across campus. 
                    I originally tried to create my own club, but that ultimately was denied, so I joined another on 
                    campus organization which would provides me client interaction. I’ve already got a number of clients 
                    that are requesting me and my work over that produced by others, which has been a very exciting experience. 
                    After this entry position, I’m hoping to get the internship I applied for earlier this week, and will start slowly 
                    advertising my services to greater Omaha during the summer of 2019. I’ll likely take a few jobs here and there 
                    during my sophomore year, and I’ll be studying abroad during the first semester of my junior year. While abroad, 
                    I want to start taking classes relating to the entrepreneurship and marketing majors I also plan on obtaining. 
                    Once I return, I want to start building out this company, and implementing the business skills I learn in class. 
                    I’ll continue to do this throughout my senior year, and I’ll apply for a traditional job during my senior year. 
                    I’ll probably remain at that company for a year or two before breaking off and freelancing full-time, where I’ll 
                    gradually increase the caliber of my clientele.
