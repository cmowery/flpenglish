                    As I talked about before, I really only connected with Mr. Thesian. He was the only speaker 
                    I found to be engaging and influential. He resonated with me for a number of reasons, 
                    but especially in his love for teaching kids. I found his desire to teach young teenagers 
                    life changing skills. I also found it was easy to relate to Mr. Thesian because he is an 
                    entrepreneur, something I aspire to be. I was extremely interested in his experiences. 
                    His failures, his successes, and his sacrifices were all things that I feel wiser for 
                    knowing before I pursue this dream of mine was helpful, especially if I don’t find 
                    myself working with someone who shares my passion for creating.

                    While he’s not an individual who spoke at seminar, another leader I look to is named 
                    Miah Sommer. Miah founded the Bike Union as a resource for children who have 
                    ‘aged out’ of the foster care system to obtain professional skills that will 
                    help them throughout their professional lives. Mr. Sommer also came from an 
                    underprivileged household, and founded the Bike Union to help kids in ways 
                    he didn’t have access to. I also had the opportunity to meet one of the people 
                    who’s lives his nonprofit has helped to transform. The individual I met has since 
                    gained incredible people skills, manages to pay her own rent, bikes to work every day, 
                    loves her job, and is saving for a car. She was homeless before her job at the Bike Union. 
                    The Bike Union is located at 1818 Dodge St Omaha, NE 68102.

                    The third person I’ve learned a significant amount from this year has been my dad. 
                    While he didn’t speak during Seminar this year, it sounds like he may speak during next year’s 
                    seminar about his transition to President of the company he works for. While it may be very biased, 
                    I found it very interesting to listen to him as he experiences everything, versus the people we’ve 
                    listened to all semester who have reflected on their careers thus-far. He’s talked to me about the 
                    struggles of letting people go, the endless travel, and the unknowns of large transitions in 
                    ublicly traded companies.
