                    One of the most interesting, and difficult things about the Trading Card assignment 
                    was assigning a label to the type of leader I was, and that I wanted to be. I realized 
                    that I tended to lead in a way that was very dictatorial, but that I wanted to become an 
                    individual who was really good about listening to others, and help to create their ideas. 
                    When working on this project with my peers, I named my leadership style, “the comrade” 
                    because of my love for working with others towards a common goal.

                    My podcast discussed whether or not managers were leaders and why we believed that. I
                     ultimately found myself not believing that managers were leaders, but rather were their own thing. 
                     The people I look to aren’t afraid of failure, inspire others, and are creative. In contrast, managers 
                     tend to avoid failure, manage others, and don’t usually try new things. I’ve loved the managers I’ve 
                     had throughout my life thus far, but it’s not the type of person I aspire to be.
